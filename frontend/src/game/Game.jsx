      <h1>
        They all know
        They all know
        Sorry did I wake your dreams?
        Some questions run too deep
        We only only wake up when we sleep
        Left by the lunar light
        Trouble's all we'd find
        Lost our way tonight
        Is it something we said?
        Is it something we said to them?
        Is it something we said?
        Save me
        I'm trapped in a vile world
        Where the end game's all the same as every other
        We're only here to die
        Save me
        I'm losing my only dream
        I could use some guiding light
        Some place to go
        If you hear me let me know
        They all know
        They all know
        Ever since the day you left
        My fate's been set unknown
        How many years to walk this path alone?
        So much to see tonight
        So why'd you close your eyes?
        Why can't I shut mine?
        Is it something we did?
        Is it something we did to them?
        Is it something we did?
        Save me
        I'm trapped in a vile world
        Where the end game's all the same as every other
        We're only here to die
        Save me
        I'm losing my only dream
        I can use some guiding light
        Some place to go
        If you hear me let me know
        If you hear me let me know
        Aaaah
        Help me find my way
        I said help me find my way
        No pulse inside of me
        Stone cold-lips and heresy
        All lies and to a degree
        Losing who (who) I wanna be
        You'll find out right now as
        He maybe out of his mind
        But some day you will find
        That sanity's left us all blind
        And dragged us all behind
        A moment seen through those eyes
        Crystal blue disguise
        They say that all beauty must die
        I say it just moves on
        If you'd only open your mind
        Then someday you will find
        Insanity's left us behind
        And walked right through the door
        I can see the pictures clear
        As yesterday pictures of my own
        I can hear the voices begging you to stay
        But know you're not alone
        Save me,
        I'm trapped in a vile world
        Where the end game's all the same as every other
        We're only here to die
        Save me
        I'm losing my only dream
        I can use some guiding light
        Some place to go
        If you hear me let me know
        If you hear me let me know
        Tonight we all die young
        Tonight we all die young
        Tonight we all die young
        Tonight we all die young
        Tonight we all die young
        Tonight we all die young
        Tonight we all die young
        Tonight we all die
        Tonight we all die young
